= README directory layers

Put the configuration file and layer specific files in this directory. Then,
move this directory outside the PorPOISe directory, so you can keep
configuration and layer specific files separate from the PorPOISe source
distribution. Adjust the constant PORPOISE_CONFIG_PATH in config.php in the
PorPOISe root directory to point to this directory and your install is
complete.

Files to put here:
- config.xml - PorPOISe configuration
- POI filter subclasses (POIConnectors)
- WebApp subclasses
- WebApp templates
- XML poi files
- XSL files for XML transformations
